# QoL Mod

Simple work in progress mod to add some quality of life features (TBD for now)

## Note

This is my first foray into modding and am mostly looking to learn from it. None
of the ideas here are probably going to be revolutionary in any aspect. I will be
testing ideas and implementing what I find interesting and can learn from. Expect
a lot of components from different tutorials I follow.

## Long Term Goals

The broad goals of this project are:

- Server side components:
    - [ ] Waypoint markers and Waystones
        - mimic existing waypoint mods to a searchable waypoints in a catalogue
        - mimic existing waystone functionality with teleports on interactions
        - Inspirations: BlayTheNinth's Waystones addon and DodgeMan's Set Home &
          Waypoints
    - [ ] Graves
        - Basic graves on death with a timer, possibly with a boss battle
        - Inspiration: FireBall1725's Graves


- Client side components:
    - [ ] Camera configuration
        - ability to zoom further in or out and offset camera in all directions in
          third person
        - adjustable zoom
        - Inspiration: henkelmax's Camera Utils
    - [ ] Generally more info
        - armour, health, food, saturation indicators
        - position, basic looking at block info, basic mob info
        - Inspirations: masady's MiniHUD and squeek502's AppleSkin


- Explicit no-go:
    - While I plan to make some custom items, nothing to fundamentally change the
      gameplay loop
    - No new ores or resources that you need to gather (except for learning
      purposes)

Any suggestions you have are welcome
